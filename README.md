Anyone who has driven in New York City may have experienced at least one unpleasant experience. 
As a driver in New York City, I have learned that our eyes must be everywhere at all times.
From watching cyclists to making sure that pedestrians are paying attention, it can be a challenging experience. In making sure that traffic laws and regulations are being followed at all times, city agencies are authorized with the power to issue traffic tickets to individuals who have violated a law or regulation. 
While all rules are crucial to follow, it is like that NYC drivers have been issued at least one traffic ticket throughout their driving experience. Today, technology has consumed our society in which the use of a mobile device while driving has impacted so many lives. Using R shiny,  we will visualize the rise of traffic tickets from 2014 to 2017.
