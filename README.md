 Overview
 ---------
Anyone who has driven in New York City may have experienced at least one unpleasant experience. As a driver in New York City (NYC), I have learned that you must remain alert at all times. From looking for cyclists before you make a turn to making  sure that pedestrians are paying attention, it can be a challenging experience. 

In making sure that traffic laws and regulations are being followed at all times, police are authorized to issue traffic tickets to individuals who have violated a traffic law or regulation. While all rules are crucial to follow, it is likely that NYC drivers have been issued  with at least one traffic ticket. 

Today, technology has become an huge part in society in which the use of mobile devices while driving has impacted so many lives. The use of technology has also benefited the police force. Through recent advance technologies in police vehicles, it is becoming easier to issue traffic violations.  Using an R shiny dashboard,  we will visualize the rise in traffic tickets from 2014 - 2017.

License Readers
----------------
 Today, it is difficult for cops to lose you on the road. Once they have detected your vehicle, your license plate is automatically listed on their system. Also, if a  cop sees that you are using your mobile device or violating a traffic law, it is not hard for them to stop and pull you over.
