 Overview

Anyone who has driven in New York City may have experienced at least one unpleasant experience. As a driver in New York City (NYC), I have learned that you must remain alert at all times. From looking for cyclists before you make a turn to making  sure that pedestrians are paying attention, it can be a challenging experience. 

In making sure that traffic laws and regulations are being followed at all times, police are authorized to issue traffic tickets to individuals who have violated a traffic law or regulation. While all rules are crucial to follow, it is likely that NYC drivers have been issued  with at least one traffic ticket.

Through recent advance technologies in police vehicles, it is becoming easier to issue traffic violations.
